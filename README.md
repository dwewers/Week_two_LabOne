Below is the code for the pair project task A

var nOne = 50; //Creates a variable "nOne" and sets it to '50' that can be used throughout the code
var nTwo = 10;  //Creates a variable "nTwo" and sets it to '10' that can be used throughout the code

var sum = nOne + nTwo; //Creates a variable called "sum" which is the sum of the declared variables
var subtract = nOne - nTwo; //Creates a variable called "subtract" which is the output of one variable subtracted from the other
var divide = nOne / nTwo; //Creates a variable called "divide" which is the product of one variable divided by the other
var percent = nOne % nTwo; //Creates a variable called "percent" which is the remainder of the one variable diveded by the other
var multiply = nOne * nTwo; //Creates a variable called "multiply" which is the product of one variable multiplied by the other
 
console.log("sum of nOne and nTwo");// prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(sum); //prints to the console the value of the variable 

console.log("subtract nTwo from nOne");// prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(subtract); //prints to the console the value of the variable

console.log("divide nOne by nTwo");// prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(divide); //prints to the console the value of the variable

console.log("Remainder of nOne divided by nTwo");// prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(percent); //prints to the console the value of the variable

console.log("nOne multiplied by nTwo");// prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(multiply); //prints to the console the value of the variable

below is the code for task B

var nOne = 10; //creates a variable called "nOne" and sets it to the value of '10'
var nTwo = 20; //creates a variable called "nTwo" and sets it to the value of '20'
var nThree = 30; //creates a variable called "nThree" and sets it to the value of '30'
var nFour = 40; //creates a variable called "nFour" and sets it to the value of '40'

var nCalc = nOne / nTwo + nThree / nOne - nFour % nFour; 
// creates a variable of the equation we want to answer so that we dont have to keep writing it out

var nCalcTwo = (nOne / nTwo) + (nThree / nOne) - (nFour % nFour);
// creates a variable of the equation we want to answer with grouping operators

console.log("Result of nOne / nTwo + nThree / nOne - nFour % nFour"); // prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(nCalc);//Prints to the console the numerical value of 'nCalc'

console.log("Result of nOne / nTwo + nThree / nOne - nFour % nFour with grouping operators")
console.log(nCalcTwo);//Prints to the console the numerical value of 'nCalcTwo'
