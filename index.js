var numOne = 50; //Creates a variable "nOne" and sets it to '50' that can be used throughout the code
var numTwo = 10;  //Creates a variable "nTwo" and sets it to '10' that can be used throughout the code

var sum = numOne + numTwo; //Creates a variable called "sum" which is the sum of the declared variables
var subtract = numOne - numTwo; //Creates a variable called "subtract" which is the output of one variable subtracted from the other
var divide = numOne / numTwo; //Creates a variable called "divide" which is the product of one variable divided by the other
var multiply = numOne * numTwo; //Creates a variable called "multiply" which is the product of one variable multiplied by the other
 // these variables are useful as we can call them later in the code, without having to type out the full value

console.log("sum of numOne and numTwo");// prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(sum); //prints to the console the value of the variable "sum"

console.log("subtract numTwo from numOne");// prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(subtract); //prints to the console the value of the variable "subtract"

console.log("divide numOne by numTwo");// prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(divide); //prints to the console the value of the variable "divide"

console.log("numOne multiplied by numTwo");// prints to the console the equation we want to answer
console.log(multiply); //prints to the console the value of the variable 'multiply"
